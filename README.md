## Overview

This project is a results summary component that I really enjoy taking part in.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

The first thing I did was go through all the files that were provided for this project. Doing that gave me an idea of how the layout should be and what CSS properties I was going to use. For example, I used the display property to create a flexbox.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to minimize my code while getting the same results. 

```css
main,.summary{
        display: flex;
        height: 100vh;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
    }
```

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to continue learning about accessibility, grid, and CSS transforms.
