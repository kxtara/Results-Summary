## Overview

This was a fun project that took me about a day to complete. I find that when I'm having trouble figuring something out, stepping away for a few minutes is good.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

The first thing I did was decide how I was going to structure the HTML. After I started with the HTML, I proceeded to the CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project put my CSS knowledge to the test, and I learned more about sizing and linear gradients.Â 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.result-text{
    background: linear-gradient(var(--Violet-blue)20%,var(--Persian-blue));
}
```

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to continue learning how to make projects that are responsive and visually pleasing for a user.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - I used this site for the font that is used in this project.
